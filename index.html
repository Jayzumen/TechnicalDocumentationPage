        <p>
          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
          dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
          "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
          (lowercase).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
          identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
          characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
          Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="Constants" class="main-section">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <p>
          You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
          syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
          identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
          can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
        </p>
        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
        <p>
          A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
          while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
          scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
          assumed to represent a variable.
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
          variable in the same scope. For example:
        </p>
        <code
          >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; <br />
          // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
          //statements }</code
        >
        <p>
          However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
          statement is executed without problems.
        </p>
        <code
          >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
          "otherValue";</code
        >
      </section>
      <section id="Data_types" class="main-section">
        <header>Data types</header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
          <li>
            null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is
            case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other
            variant.
          </li>
          <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
          <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
          <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
          <li>
            Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
            unique and immutable.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
          you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
          functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
          think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
          procedures that your application can perform.
        </p>

      <section id="while_statement" class="main-section">
        <header>while statement</header>
        <p>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
        </p>
        <code>while (condition) statement</code>
        <p>
          If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops
          executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
          the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
          tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
          control is passed to the statement following while.
        </p>
        <p>
          To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
          group those statements.
        </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>
          The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
        </p>
        <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
        <p>
          With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
          Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
          <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
          <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer
          true, so the loop terminates.
